# i should use that f string thing with the fancy curlique brackets to show the user what they input, 
# so if they get weird results, they can check to see if they accidentally input the wrong things
# can i make it like a checklist, so I assign variables to different options for different questions
#(there should only be 2-3 options for each question so this is feasible) and I could say, if its dry, type D, if its 
# sandy, type Y, and could assign those letters, and could say if (need variable for plants) == Y, then run, or something
# like that, and can use if/elif/else statements to check if it matches, can I make it like a funnel?
# would it work like a funnel if I had multiple while loops running inside of each other? or some kind of loop thing
# where there are loops in loops, and it would probably need to start in the smallest loop, and then go to the next and the next,
# until at the end, I get to the loop that is the least, and the plan would be that at the beginning the program accepted all of the plants, 
# and then it cut out the ones that didnt match the first criteria, and then there are some that didnt match the later criteria
# and it keeps cutting out the ones that dont have the same answer in each loop, and then what would ulimately happen, is that 
# if there were no plants that matched all of the criteria, it would say "sorry there are no plants that match those criteria. Try again and 
# ajust the criteria" which would be maybe annoying to the user, but that can happen on zillow too, and its annoying but we 
# make do. And I don't think I can make it so the user can adjust the criteria to which are most important, 
# but if I could figure it out, that would be the best, but that would I think involve giving the user the ability
# to change the code, because of the loop system, if it works, that i came up with
# it would be cool, if, at the end, I could ask for their zipcode, and then spit out all of the places they 
# might be able to buy the seeds/seedlings that they wanted, but then again, maybe that is unhelpful, because I cant tell them
# if the place has them in stock, maybe that could be another project though? that could be cool
# (1)sun v. part sun v. shade, (3)basic v. acidic, v. nuetrual v. opt out, (2)sand v. clay
# (5)high water v. low water, v. medium water, (4)plant in summer v. winter v. spring v. fall, (6) annual v. perrenial --> lasts a year or lasts 5 years?

# radishes, sandy (needs airaited soil, so doesnt do well in clay), winter, medium water (moist but no wet), sun/ part sun, acidic
# lettuce, fall planting, medium water,
